# ImsAuthProps

The `ImsAuthProps` properties define the authentication information and flow that the Asset Selector uses to obtain an `imsToken`. By setting these properties, you can control how the authentication flow should behave and register listeners for various authentication events.

| Property Name             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `imsClientId`             | A string value representing the IMS client ID used for authentication purposes. This value is provided by Adobe and is specific to your Adobe AEM CS organization.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `imsScope`                | Describes the scopes used in authentication. The scopes determine the level of access that the application has to your organization resources. Multiple scopes can be separated by commas.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `redirectUrl`             | Represents the URL where the user is redirected after authentication. This value is typically set to the current URL of the application. If a `redirectUrl` is not supplied, `ImsAuthService` will use the redirectUrl used to register the `imsClientId`                                                                                                      |
| `modalMode`               | A boolean indicating whether the authentication flow should be displayed in a modal (pop-up) or not. If set to `true`, the authentication flow is displayed in a pop-up. If set to `false`, the authentication flow is displayed in a full page reload. _Note:_ for better UX, you can dynamically control this value if the user has browser pop-up disabled. |
| `onImsServiceInitialized` | A callback function that is called when the Adobe IMS authentication service is initialized. This function takes one parameter, `service`, which is an object representing the Adobe IMS service. See [`ImsAuthService`](#imsauthservice-ims-auth-service) for more details.                                                                                   |
| `onAccessTokenReceived`   | A callback function that is called when an `imsToken` is received from the Adobe IMS authentication service. This function takes one parameter, `imsToken`, which is a string representing the access token.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `onAccessTokenExpired`    | A callback function that is called when an access token has expired. This function is typically used to trigger a new authentication flow to obtain a new access token.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `onErrorReceived`         | A callback function that is called when an error occurs during authentication. This function takes two parameters: the error type and error message. The error type is a string representing the type of error and the error message is a string representing the error message.                                                                               |
